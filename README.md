# PKs Tab Tools

## New Tab Options

Allows you to set a custom URL to the new tab page. The newtab page can be redirected
to the specified page or loaded within an iframe for a cleaner omnibar if the resulting
server supports it. You can also design your own local html file and use that as
the newtab page using a URL starting with `file://`.

This does not replace your homepage, only new tabs.

## Pinned Tab Options

Allows you to save and load pinned tabs for use at a later date. This is useful when
working with different environments or projects and want to reload all the tools you
had previously opened.
